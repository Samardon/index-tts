1
There was once a kingdom called Tenbahl.

2
It was long a land of peace, and its
people lived in happiness.

3
But one day, it was suddenly
overwhelmed by monsters.

4
And so the king called upon its best spirit mage,

5
and ordered him to defeat them.

6
But there were so many monsters
that it was a grueling battle.

7
The young man, covered in wounds, made
a request of his spirit companion.

8
"I don't care what happens to me.
Please, unleash your full power."

9
Thinking that this would be his end,
the spirit gently hugged him,

10
said, "I understand," and granted his wish.

11
In an instant, all of the monsters
were exterminated.

12
The young man then collapsed,
his strength drained.

13
Tears in her eyes, the spirit picked him up,
said, "I won't let you die,"

14
and then returned to the spirit realm.

15
Peace returned to the kingdom,

16
and the young man became the hero who
saved it from the Monster Tempest.

17
But no matter how many years
passed, he never returned.

18
To this day, everyone in the kingdom
continues to pray for his safety.

19
So, what happened to the hero?

20
He got saved, right? When's he coming back?

21
He already did, though.

22
Ellen.

23
Um, excuse me, could I get two kebabs, please?

24
Coming right up!

25
Are you ever going to go back home, Father?

26
It's not that simple.

27
Here you go.

28
Excuse me, could I also get two?

29
Sure!

30
Huh?!

31
Master Rovel?!

32
Ghk!

33
D-Did he say Master Rovel?!

34
Master Rovel?

35
- The hero?
- Oh, crap! We gotta book it, Ellen!

36
It is him!

37
Please, wait!

38
There he is!

39
Master Rovel!

40
I'm so glad to see you well!

41
So you've finally returned to us!

42
I'm just so...

43
So happy to...

44
Huh?

45
Whaaat?! But why?!

46
[The Hero's Homecoming]

47
That was a close one.

48
Why'd you run? Why not just pay home a visit?

49
It'd be a pain.

50
But why?

51
Because they went and made me
a hero while I was gone!

52
There's no way it won't be
a pain! I can't take it!

53
- I just can't!
- This man is the hero who saved this country,

54
- This man is the hero who saved this country,

55
as well as my father, Rovel Vankreift.

56
The truth is, that story didn't end there.

57
It was thought that my spent father
wouldn't wake up for a few years,

58
but thanks to the devotion shown by
my mother, Spirit Queen Origin,

59
he recovered in just one.

60
Then they fell in love, exchanged vows,

61
and Father became a half-spirit.

62
But because of that, he lost
control of his powers,

63
so he trained in the spirit realm,

64
and a few months ago, he came here to
acclimate his powers to the human realm.

65
And, well, I'm their daughter,

66
born eight years ago,

67
but I was actually reincarnated.

68
Before being reborn, I was a scientist
in a country called Japan.

69
I spent my days composing,
measuring, and prototyping

70
in the name of developing new
elements and materials.

71
But at some point, I up and died somehow.

72
I don't know if it was karma or what,

73
- but I reincarnated here. Also,
- I didn't get a single bite of meat.

74
maybe because I still have my memories,

75
I couldn't control my powers and caused
a real issue when I was two.

76
And so I'm training with him!

77
They saw me teleport, too, so it's gonna
get even more annoying.

78
It's your fault for not contacting them, Father.

79
Why not go home and at least say hi?

80
That might also get them to stop chasing you.

81
Stop being so right.

82
I knew it. It is you, Master Rovel!

83
Ah! Please, wait! At least hear me out!

84
Father.

85
Do you know him, Father?

86
Huh? Father?

87
He's Alberto. My former guard.

88
This is my daughter! Cute, right?!
Cutest in the world!

89
Look! Her hair's a glistening platinum!

90
And her eyes sparkle like gems! You agree,
right? Just the best, right?!

91
S-Sure...

92
I'm relieved to see you well.

93
So, what did you want to say?

94
The house of Duke Vankreift, and everyone in it,

95
has eagerly awaited your return.

96
Duke...?

97
Due to your contributions during
the Monster Tempest ten years ago,

98
the Vankreift family was elevated to dukedom.

99
Your younger brother, Master Sauvel,
is serving as its head.

100
Then I don't need to return.

101
No. No! Please come back to us!

102
Why? You don't need me.

103
The truth is, his wife, Madam Agielle...

104
Wait, wife? Sauvel married that woman?!

105
Y-Yes. It was a royal order. He couldn't refuse.

106
I'm not going back. Not if she's there!

107
But...

108
I won't!

109
Father.

110
I don't know the circumstances,
but you've worried everyone.

111
It is your duty to go home and meet with them.

112
But that's...

113
I'm disappointed my father
doesn't cherish his family.

114
I hate you.

115
You hate me?!

116
Ellen! I get it! I get it already! I'll go home!

117
So please, don't hate me!

118
Pleeease!

119
Okay, Father!

120
Um, what's Agielle like?

121
She's Tenbahl's second princess.

122
And she was once my fiancee.

123
Huh?

124
Be grateful that I am deigning to marry
into the Vankreift house!

125
But I had the engagement annulled
before I went to battle.

126
After all, there was no guarantee I'd survive.

127
The engagement was a one-sided
decision from Madam Agielle.

128
And once Master Sauvel became
a duke, he caught her eye.

129
It's been ten years.

130
You spent ten years in the spirit realm.

131
What kind of life have you lived there?

132
So, you want me to throw her out?

133
Y-Yes.

134
The truth is, the Vankreift house is on the verge
of bankruptcy due to her extravagance.

135
So it's my fault Sauvel fell victim to her...

136
Change of plans! There's somewhere
I need to go first.

137
My, who have we here?

138
And what brings you to a place like this?

139
Wait...

140
Is that Rovel, the hero?!

141
Yeah. Long time no see.

142
Anyway, can this church handle
marriage registrations?

143
Excuse me?

144
We had a ceremony over there, but I
want something concrete here, too.

145
My word, you're married?!

146
Forgive me, yes, I can draw up a registration.

147
Thanks.

148
But are you certain? You're a noble, Lord Rovel.

149
Would you rather go to the capital...

150
No. I want to make it official immediately.

151
Please hurry.

152
Y-Yes, sir.

153
Father, why are you having
a wedding all of a sudden?

154
Because that woman's in my house. I want
to take every available measure.

155
Huh?

156
Wow!

157
Everything is ready.

158
The twin goddesses, Vohl the All-Seeing,

159
and Vahl the Judge, will
witness your marriage.

160
Excuse me, but your partner...?

161
I'll call her.

162
Excuse me?

163
Ori! Come to me!

164
Let's get married here!

165
Rovel!

166
How lovely! We get to marry
in the human realm, too!

167
It won't be anything too fancy. Is that okay?

168
Of course it is, dear.

169
Father, you're so dashing!

170
A-A spirit?

171
Yeah. I'm already half-spirit, myself.

172
That means we're both spirits,
so we can get married.

173
We meet again.

174
You were the one...

175
Do you vow to love one another
in sickness and in health?

176
I do.

177
I do.

178
Then please, sign your registration.

179
Father! Mother!

180
Let's celebrate!

181
Please hold out your left hands!

182
Hm?

183
Atomic number seventy-eight,

184
platinum!

185
Your left ring finger is linked
directly to your heart,

186
and it's said to symbolize creation.

187
Dear wishes to protect your partner, love,
happiness, and the realization of wishes...

188
That finger holds so much meaning!

189
And to top it off...

190
Atomic number six, carbon, makes...

191
A diamond!

192
Ooh!

193
Diamond?

194
Eternal bonds, certainty, and purity!

195
Diamonds represent all that!

196
I love it, Ellen.

197
Yeah.

198
I can't give you a rice shower,

199
but may you both receive the diamond's blessings!

200
Receiving such a wonderful blessing from
our daughter... I couldn't be happier.

201
Nor could I, dear.

202
Ohh! My word, this is...!

203
My sisters, Vahl and Vohr, are
also offering their blessings!

204
The goddesses have borne witness to your marriage.

205
I now declare you husband and wife!

206
Since reincarnating as a spirit,

207
I've had the power to freely control
elements and their compositions.

208
That's right! I have a cheat skill!

209
She just created a miracle...

210
That's Master Rovel's child?

211
You can have these, Mr. Priest!

212
Please use them if you're in a tight spot!

213
My word!

214
Thank you for your generosity!

215
Father! You looked so cool up there!

216
What? Really?!

217
Shame you don't now.

218
What?! Why?!

219
Rovel, I want to have a kebab, too!

220
What? A kebab? Now?!

221
Master Rovel, Madam Origin!

222
I offer you my sincere congratulations.

223
Thank you, Alberto.

224
Now, I'll be heading back home, but could you
take Ellen back to the spirit realm, Ori?

225
But why?

226
Because there's no telling what
that woman will do to you.

227
And I don't want to let you two into her sights.

228
You can watch me through the water mirror, right?

229
Good idea.

230
After all, if I saw her, I'd want
to throw a fireball at her.

231
It sounds like you see her as an enemy.

232
That's about right. She's your father's enemy.

233
Plus, if the royal family learned about you,

234
and tried to arrange a marriage,

235
I'd have to respond violently.

236
Surely you're overthinking...

237
What do you mean?!

238
Look how cute Ellen is!

239
I beg your pardon!

240
I understand your concerns,
and I wish you success.

241
Thanks, Ori.

242
Now, I'm off!

243
Bye!

244
See you later!

245
Indeed.

246
Ahh, no way! I don't wanna! I refuse!

247
I'm going home with you two!

248
You need to resolve this.

249
You can do it, Father!

250
Ugh.

251
I guess so.

252
Now...

253
Let us watch over him with the water mirror.

254
Yes, Mother!

255
I understand his aversion.

256
Madam Agielle's obsession with
him was beyond extreme.

257
She forced her way into betrothal with him,

258
and was extraordinarily prideful,
arrogant, and wasteful.

259
Master Rovel was exasperated by her obsession,
and grew more expressionless by the year.

260
Then, when he turned nineteen,

261
the Monster Tempest occurred.

262
Using the uncertainty of his survival as pretext,
he petitioned for an annulment.

263
Madam Agielle was infuriated, and used
her standing as a royal to get revenge.

264
She sent Master Rovel and
his father to the front lines.

265
We knights have been tasked
with eliminating the monsters!

266
Stay sharp!

267
Yes, sir!

268
They've come.

269
Take care of it, Rovel.

270
Fight well, Father.

271
The rest is as the picture books say.

272
His father lost his life, and Master
Rovel was spirited away.

273
But for all that, he's really changed.

274
He never would have made those faces before.

275
Perhaps he regained in the spirit realm
the happiness he lost ten years ago.

276
If so...

277
Master Rovel.

278
Hm?

279
I am truly sorry.

280
I know full well that that woman is self-centered
enough to drive you into a corner.

281
I bear some responsibility for leaving you
to her whims for ten years.

282
Don't be sorry.

283
That flag...!

284
The hero!

285
The hero has returned to us!

286
Oh?

287
The hero has returned!

288
He has! Master Rovel has returned!

289
Master Rovel!

290
Welcome home!

291
Oh my! Master Rovel!

292
I apologize for my long absence.

293
It pleases me to see you all well.

294
And I am delighted that you would all
welcome me home like this!

295
Master Rovel!

296
We have eagerly awaited your return.

297
We are glad to see you home safe!

298
Thanks.

299
I'm home.

300
Now, please, hurry inside.

301
Is it true that Lord Rovel has returned?!

302
Lord Rovel!

303
Who is that...?

304
Master Sauvel's wife,

305
Madam Agielle.

306
You haven't changed one bit, just like me!

307
She looks like a whole different person.

308
Master Rovel!

309
How wonderful!

310
My father forced me to marry your brother,
yet you haven't forgotten me!

311
You finally came to get me back!

312
You spout nonsense!

313
Mother! Mother! Stop! Stop now!
You'll burn down the castle!

314
You saw it, right, Ellen?

315
This swine...

316
is Agielle.

317
This woman... is Father's enemy!
